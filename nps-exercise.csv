- we use the inline comments heavily during code reviews. once you've left some inline comments, the code in the PR becomes pretty unreadable b/c it's broken up by the big comment boxes. i think some UI changes that allows for leaving comments, signaling them to people, but allowing you to still look through the code as-is would go a long way.

- i think easier ways to diff various code would help too. you guys have added a lot to this recently, which is fantastic. a few quick examples...diffing the latest changes in a PR to the both the last change as well as master would be huge. helpful in reviews to see what was changed since the last time i reviewed the code. i'm sure this exists, but i havent found it easily yet (im also prob not looking hard enough!)",Private business projects,"we use asana for bug tracking and project tracking. i would switch over to github issues in a second if you had a simple ""email a bug in"" and have it filed automatically. asana has this and it's gold for testing mobile apps. filing a bug from a mobile app? you screenshot it and email it in. it's the easiest/best way to do it. add users to the to: or cc: and they get assigned.

I'd like to use it for my business's code too, but your billing model excludes that. I'm currently bootstrapping a startup.

I have a lot of closed source repos that I need to backup somewhere, and all things being equal, GitHub would be my first choice.

All things are not equal.

I've got 3 closed source repos that I'm actively using at the moment, but altogether I've got 39. I collaborate with just 2 other people, and that's only on two of those private repos.

I store them all on Bitbucket. Why? Because at the scale I'm currently at, it's free.

I'm really just using Bitbucket for backup. None of my private repos are making any money yet, so the $50/month cost of hosting all that stuff on GitHub is actually fairly significant. I'd be paying for it out of my own pocket.

Bitbucket's billing model (up to five collaborators are free) seems to fit much better with the way small companies grow. I can't afford to pay for code hosting until my startup is making money. Once it's making money I'm likely to need to start hiring. I'll be paying those people, at which point the $50/month for GitHub will seem like a drop in the ocean, and I'd happily pay that for the collaboration features.

Only I won't, because I'm now entrenched in Bitbucket. If you check my user ID (@gma) you'll find I've been on GitHub since the early days. And yet I use Bitbucket, and they're going to make money out of me once I start hiring and cross their collaboration threshold. Something must be wrong with that, mustn't it?

I once explained this to Scott C in a pub, but he said that they'd run the numbers and that people like me weren't in GitHub's target market.",,,

Unrelatedly, it'd be nice if GitHub started showing off a bit more of how it's a nice *interface* on top of things that generally git can do already. E.g., find a way to indicate to users how the blame tab corresponds to `git blame`, how clicking the green button relates to `git merge`, etc. etc. In particular besides being useful for learning, not having that means that people who know how git works (ha ha) probably find it hard to use parts of GitHub because it isn't obvious what *exactly* they're doing to the repo (e.g., ""does the green button do a ff merge? No? Yes? Going to have to click to find out."")

Some of the organization settings are hard to figure out. Ie. I once set all the projects in one organization to send me emails to a work email instead of the private one. Recently I wanted to repeat that feat for another organization and just could not find this setting anymore.

The bug submission interface should not automatically cross-reference bugs when the '#' character followed by a number is used. People often paste gdb stack traces without quoting them properly and this causes early bugs to by referenced bazillion of times for no reason.

History view is nice but not particularly readable. It would be good to make it so that you can see the forks and merges like in cgit.

The commit notification emails are not very readable.

Notifications about tags are completely useless, it would be nice it they could contain list of changes since the last tag grouped by author, like in the default git notifier.

It is not possible to send issue update notifications to a mailing list. This is a feature that we used to use a lot. Currently we simulate it with a fake user account.",Open source projects,I would like to have the email notifications improved.,GitHub.com,,

— find a way to encourage forkers to describe their improvements in the README.md, rather than leaving the README exactly as the original",GitHub.com,,

The GitHub app is merely a launcher for a web access to the repo.  While working  with a shared repo that isn't mine, I ""forked"" then ""cloned"" the main branch.  The main branch was then advanced to new versions.  For some reason, my fork stayed behind at the old version.  I tried forking the new branch, but it always seemed to be stuck on the version I originally forked.  So I ended up deleting my fork and braving through all the very daunting warnings, which is nothing but daunting.  Now I've forked the new version and hopefully that will work for now.

Looking into help, the documentation quickly resorts to commandline, with sparse examples and conditions that rarely apply to what I need to do.  The help is useless.

Ideally, GitHub would have an app similar to perforce.  Without it, I only feel like I did facing those daunting warnings about deleting my fork, like I don't know what I'm doing.

It's a good, responsive, ergonomic site--has been and continues to be.  Placement of buttons sometimes a little counter-intuitive.

Even by Wikipedia/MediaWiki standards it's bad.

The issue tracker is promising and has some great integration with commits, but is still rather basic as such systems go.  Even the features that are there require too much hand-holding.  It should be easier to draw from a common pool of tags; the idea that every project must create its own tag list is annoying.

In a system which is all about versioning, editing an issue should create a history...modeled like StackOverflow's versioning on posts.  They've got that down pretty well, including the 5 minute grace period to not create a new version if you were just editing out typos or having a quick second thought.",Open source projects,"One wish that is the wish for unlimited wish fulfillment: Release your platform as free software under the Affero General Public License!

There's already open source alternatives to GitHub, that are...not as good.  There are closed source alternatives to GitHub that are...eh, about as good.  (Better at some things, not as good at others, almost always less ergonomic.)

GitHub.com would be the central place where GitHub features are worked on.  You are the ones who know how to deploy and work on it.  Maybe a clone site would pop up here or there; but the odds of them rising as trustworthy competitors for a commercial audience would be slim.  If they made any unique features they would be required to release the code under the Affero terms.

GitHub already has good PR with open source, this would seal the deal pretty much forever by being the first to make the announcement.  Go from being admired for being fairly good to being gods.  Continue collecting revenue as the #1 host for commercial projects using the open source platform and let an army of little patching ants ensure your platform is the only one people consider using.",,,

maybe another related/linked page for any major terms.

something like 

""git init: Initializes a new Git repository. Until you run this command inside a repository or directory, it’s just a regular folder. Only after you input this does it accept further Git commands.""   -readwrite.com github for beginners

the git related terms are limited, and everything assumes you know very little about git. the built in help tool works if you are familiar with git already, but before your familiar with git, this list should explain things in the lingo that most people with little advanced computer knowledge can understand. the only word here not related to git that anyone could not be able to understand is directory, but most people using git will already know what a directory is.

""git merge: When you’re done working on a branch, you can merge your changes back to the master branch, which is visible to all collaborators. 
git merge cats 
would take all the changes you made to the “cats” branch and add them to the master."" 
from the same source is a bit later on and is more complicated. the main difference is this is organized like a book, and git branch was already explained the only thing not specified is where you need to be to merge master with cats (in master) which should be noted. the explanations should be very clear and assume nothing except that the person has already read everything before it.
